### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Parham and I am a software engineer and team leader with industry experience building websites And mobile applications, which was my purpose since I was 13 years old when I have started learning programming by myself. My specialities are JavaScript and PHP which most of my projects are done with them , but I always consider myself as a junior who wants to learn more and more. As a team leader I learn how to deal with challenges and problems by using the most out of my team because I believe the teamwork is a heart of every successful team.

ðŸ‘¯ Currently, Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source project

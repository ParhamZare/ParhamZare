### Hi there 👋

<!--
**ParhamZare/ParhamZare** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
My name is Parham and I am a software engineer and team leader with industry experience building websites And mobile applications, which was my purpose since I was 13 years old when I have started learning programming by myself. My specialities are JavaScript and PHP which most of my projects are done with them , but I always consider myself as a junior who wants to learn more and more. As a team leader I learn how to deal with challenges and problems by using the most out of my team because I believe the teamwork is a heart of every successful team.
